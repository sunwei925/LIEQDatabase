# LIEQDatabase
The Low-light Image Enhancement Quality Database

## Introduction

We build a large-scale low-light image enhancement quality (LIEQ) database. The LIEQ database includes 1,000 light-enhanced images, which are generated from 100 low-light images using 10 low-light image enhancement algorithm. The LIEQ database will be publicly released after our paper "Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Low-light Image Enhancement" is accepted.
